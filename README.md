Code Snippets from current project in developement: Guild Armory

Guild Armory is in active development and not currently open source.

Guild Armory is a discord bot that stores player info from world of warcraft classic.
Raid leaders can create raid rosters, track loot, and see player progress in real-time using warcraft logs analytics and auto-generated google sheets.

These files are a very small portion of the project's code, but give insight into its innerworkings.
