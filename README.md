Guild Armory is a discord bot that stores player info from world of warcraft classic.
Raid leaders can create raid rosters, track loot, and see player progress in real-time using warcraft logs analytics and auto-generated google sheets.

**These files are a very small portion of the project's non-critical code, but give insight into its innerworkings**

Check the Screenshots folder to see how private discord desicion trees function and previews of the information that can be auto generated into reports via Google Sheets.  
*Note: any public channel commands are automatically pruded during the Bot during its response to keep channels tidy, so the triggering commands are not visible in screenshots.*
